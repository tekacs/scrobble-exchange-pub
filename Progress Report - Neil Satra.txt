Progress Report - Neil Satra

Django Frontend Code
I wrote dummy data to mock up the objects that will eventually be received from the API, with matching naming conventions, and made it available to the templates.

Also, Last.fm authentication is now supported, so that users are redirected to a Last.fm page where they can give the Scrobble Exchange app permissions to access their profile. Last.fm then redirects back to us, with a token that can be used for API calls. Functionality to redirect back to the specific page that the user was on previously still needs to be added.

Game mechanics
Took key decisions with Karolis and Asen regarding how to price stocks, how often to update and reward users.

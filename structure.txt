structure.txt [1]
=============

Just to give some sort of indication how the application is structured, here are all possible flows:

-> == network; /\ == library use

user JS /\ (JS LFM client?) -> last.fm API ... and back

user -> web /\ API client -> API /\ DATM /\ pyLast -> last.fm API -> database ... and back
user -> web /\ API client -> API /\ DATM -> backend database ... and back

(clearly this is going to have *incredibly* low latency! :P)
(for reference's sake, the contingency plan should this be impossibly slow is to link [2] the web app directly against DATM)

user /\ API client -> API /\ DATM -> backend database ... and back

analytics /\ DATM -> backend database
analytics /\ DATM -> last.fm API ... and back

[1]: This is _not_ supposed to be a markdown file, even if I liberally make use of markdown-like syntax. :P
[2]: Yes, I realise that Python doesn't link against libraries per-se - the idea is to bundle it in for direct access to the DB rather than through the API.

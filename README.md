# Scrobble Exchange: A massively multiplayer game

## Group Project Charlie

There is currently supposed to be nothing in this branch but for the README.

Please don't commit files in here!

Please also be very wary of `git pull origin <branch>` - it *will* merge all changes pulled into the current branch.
If you accidentally do this, please nuke your local repo and re-`clone`, unpick the merge carefully, or _ask_ if unsure.
The correct command to grab a branch without merging changes is `git fetch origin <branch>`.
To change to another branch, use `git checkout <branch>`.
